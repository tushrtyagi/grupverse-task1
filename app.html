              <h2>About The Lab</h2>
              <p>QuantLase Lab, a subsidiary of International Holdings Company (IHC) in Abu Dhabi, is a research and innovation laboratory focused on developing sustainable solutions for the UAE community. The research contributes to the realization of the UAE 2021 vision where innovation, science, research, and technology form the basis of a productive and competitive knowledge-based economy.
                <br>
                From medical innovation to research, our latest project focuses on the recent developments in countering the COVID-19 pandemic. We introduce a scientific breakthrough of a rapid coronavirus laser testing technology, which uses an appealing and user-friendly technique called the Diffractive Phase Interferometry (DPI). Compared to other tests, DPI is able to give a signature of the infection within a few seconds. The research is solidly based on deformational changes in cell structure of the virus-infected blood.</p>

            <h3> Ultrafast Probing of Virus - based on DPI</h3>
            
            <h1 >Al Ain 019 Invention</h1>
            <p>
                QuantLase Lab developed the novel equipment Al Ain 019, which enables ultrafast mass screenings for COVID-19 Virus, with test results available in seconds, allowing testing on a wider scale. Using a CMOS detector, this breakthrough’s ability in mass-scale screening’ will change the whole dimension of tracing, and the speed with which workforces can be approached.
                <br>
                In terms of early stage detection, Al Ain 019’s laser-based DPI [Diffractive Phase Interferometry] technique is capable of detect ing a viral infection as soon as the blood cell gets infected. Furthermore, the advanced artificial intelligence (Al) image-analysis model used in the diagnostic system predicts the outcome of each image with precision, speed and scale.
                <br>
                As of May 2020, Al Ain 01 as already been used to conduct more than 6,000 tests, with 85 to 90 percent accuracy.</p>

                <p>Dr. Pramod Kumar heads the research team at QuantLase Lab. His research interests are in the field of ultrafast nonlinear photonics covering various fundamental and applicative aspects, in particular the understanding, control and utilization of ultrashort pulse to probe spatiotemporal complex nonlinear dynamical behavior determining the performance of nonlinear photonics devices like Photonic Integrated Circuit on the chip scale, diode laser with ultra-short laser pulse injection, optical parametric oscillators, delay- coupled diode lasers system, nanostructures of semiconductors. Dr. Kumar’s focus is on the study and coherent manipulation of light through photonic structures. Moreover, he has been working on tailoring a non-deterministic white chaotic entropy source based on Optical Perturbative Interferometry for the QKD applications.</p>

                Al Ain 019’s laser-based DPI technique, based on optical- phase modulation, is able to give a signature of infection within a few seconds. What’s more, it is user-friendly, non- invasive and low-cost. The device is suitable for use not only in hospitals and public places like cinemas and shopping malls, but with a little hands-on training it can be used for in- hou testing and monitoring. We believe it will be a game- changer in tackling the spread of the coronavirus.
